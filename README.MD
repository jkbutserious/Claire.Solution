# Eau Claire's Salon

#### C# practice for Epicodus, 07.31.2020

## By Jeff Kim

## Description

Pierre's friend Claire has been looking to streamline her business and better manage her stylists and clients.

This project uses C#, MySQL, Entity Framework, and MVC to create a web interface that will allow Claire to add stylists to a database and use her system to keep track of each stylist's clients. Claire will be able to add clients in each stylist's details page and make sure that clients cannot be added without a stylist.
